            <h1>Feeding the Newest New Yorkers: Rethink Food's Restaurant Partners and Shelter Sites</h1>
        </div>
        <p>More than 180,000 asylum seekers have arrived in New York City in the last 18 months.</p>
        <p>Rethink Food is a New York City-based nonprofit with a mission of combating food insecurity. </p>
        <p>Currently, Rethink is contracted with the city government to provide three meals a day at various temporary asylum seeker shelter sites in New York City. </p>
        <p>Rethink supplies these meals by partnering with local restaurants. The restaurants cook the meals and deliver them to the shelter sites, with Rethink providing organizational and logistical support.</p>
        <p>This map shows selected asylum seeker shelter sites and the locations of Rethink's restaurant partners. This information will allow Rethink to plan its delivery processes more efficiently.</p>
        <!-- Obviously this amount of information isn't super useful yet, but in the coming weeks I will be able to flesh this out with more details to help decisionmaking, like maybe travel time between sites -->
